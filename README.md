This projects deals with predicting monthly alcohol sales in the US. 
Towards this, we estimate multiple models such as ARMA, Seasonal Components, and Vector Autoregressors. 
We identify potential predictors such as lagged values of monthly sales, unemployment rate,
CPI of food and beverage, CPI of tobacco and smoking products, and disposable income,
to explore the impact of these variables on the monthly alcohol sales in the US. Data is obtained from FRED website.
We use monthly data for each of these variables starting from 1/1/1992 to 12/31/2018.
We have also split the datasets into two samples: training sample, starting from 1/1/1992 to 12/31/2017 
and the test sample, starting from 1/1/2018 to 12/31/2018.

The study is developed in Python, through a well-docuemnted Jupyter Notebook.
